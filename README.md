# tiny-operator
ðŸŽ¶ Hold me close you tiny operator ðŸŽ¶

The purpose of this project is to provide the initial operator strapping to allow rapid testing of
CRD deployment and other k8s object creation outside of a dedicated operator.  All of the operator code
(that isn't tied up with code generation) is located in `cmd/operator/main.go`.  Modify the `createCRD`,
`onApplyEcho` and `onDeleteEcho` functions to run quick minikube tests on how k8s will handle
a CRD and the associated objects it handles (replicasets, deployments, statefulsets, etc.)

## Running the operator

 1. Checkout the code.
 1. `dep ensure` the dependencies.
 1. Run the operator (at minikube)

    ```
    $ go run cmd/operator/main.go --kubecfg-file=${HOME}/.kube/config
    ```
